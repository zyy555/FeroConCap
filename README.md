## Overview

This repository contains the official PyTorch implementation of FeroConCap, a novel method that integrates capsule networks with supervised contrastive learning to accurately identify ferroptosis-related proteins from sequences.
It includes:
- Integration of **Capsule Networks** for hierarchical feature learning
- **Supervised Contrastive Learning** for discriminative representation
- **Automatic feature extraction** without handcrafted features
